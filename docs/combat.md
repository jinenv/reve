# INTEGRATION GUIDE: Tiered Abilities + Advanced Combat Service

## üéØ HOW THE COMPLETE SYSTEM WORKS

### 1. ABILITY RESOLUTION (Your Current System Enhanced)
```python
# AbilityService.resolve_esprit_abilities() follows this priority:

# TIERS 1-5: Universal Element-Based Abilities
if tier <= 5:
    # Get from "universal_element_abilities" section
    # All Inferno Esprits get same abilities, scaled by tier
    # Example: Tier 3 Inferno = "Fire Bolt" with ["burn"] effect
    
# TIERS 6+: Custom Esprit-Specific Abilities  
if tier >= 6:
    # Get from "custom_esprit_abilities" section
    # Each named Esprit gets unique custom abilities
    # Example: "Flameheart" = "Heart Burn" with ["burn", "vulnerability_mark", "power_siphon"]
```

### 2. COMBAT INTEGRATION
```python
# When player uses ability in combat:

# Step 1: Get ability from AbilityService
ability_data = await AbilityService.resolve_esprit_abilities("Flameheart", 6, "inferno")
# Returns: {"basic": {"name": "Heart Burn", "effects": ["burn", "vulnerability_mark", "power_siphon"]}}

# Step 2: Process in CombatService
damage = calculate_base_damage(attack, defense, ability_power)
for effect_name in ability_data.effects:
    await CombatService._apply_effect(effect_name, combat_state, "boss", damage, source_tier=6)
    
# Step 3: Advanced effects scale by tier
# Tier 6 Flameheart's "burn" = more powerful than Tier 1 basic burn
# Tier 6 gets "vulnerability_mark" + "power_siphon" that Tier 1-5 can't access
```

### 3. PROGRESSION EXAMPLES

## TIER 1 INFERNO ESPRIT:
```python
abilities = {
    "basic": {"name": "Ember Strike", "effects": []},           # No effects
    "ultimate": {"name": "Blazing Rage", "effects": ["burn"]}   # Basic burn only
}
# Effect scaling: burn = 5.5% damage per turn
```

## TIER 5 INFERNO ESPRIT:
```python  
abilities = {
    "basic": {"name": "Infernal Strike", "effects": ["burn", "vulnerability_mark"]},
    "ultimate": {"name": "Inferno Blast", "effects": ["burn", "elemental_weakness"]}
}
# Effect scaling: burn = 7.5% damage per turn, vulnerability = 20% per stack
```

## TIER 6 FLAMEHEART (CUSTOM):
```python
abilities = {
    "basic": {"name": "Heart Burn", "effects": ["burn", "vulnerability_mark", "power_siphon"]},
    "ultimate": {"name": "Soul Incinerate", "effects": ["burn", "berserker_rage", "elemental_weakness"]}
}
# Effect scaling: burn = 8% damage per turn, vulnerability = 21% per stack, siphon = 8% per turn
```

### 4. TEAM SYSTEM INTEGRATION
```python
# Player's team in combat:
team = {
    "leader": "Flameheart" (Tier 6),      # Full abilities + advanced effects
    "support1": "Thornguard" (Tier 7),   # Support skill: "Toxic Embrace" 
    "support2": "Stormcaller" (Tier 8)   # Support skill: "Lightning Speed"
}

# Combat actions available:
- "‚öîÔ∏è Heart Burn" (Leader basic with 3 effects)
- "üí• Soul Incinerate" (Leader ultimate with 3 effects)  
- "üõ°Ô∏è Toxic Embrace" (Support 1 skill)
- "‚ö° Lightning Speed" (Support 2 skill)
```

### 5. EFFECT POWER SCALING
```python
# Same effect, different tiers = different power:

# TIER 1: power_siphon = 5.5% steal per turn
# TIER 6: power_siphon = 8% steal per turn  
# TIER 12: power_siphon = 11% steal per turn

# TIER 1: vulnerability_mark = 16% per stack, max 5 stacks
# TIER 6: vulnerability_mark = 21% per stack, max 6 stacks
# TIER 12: vulnerability_mark = 27% per stack, max 8 stacks
```

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES NEEDED

### 1. UPDATE esprit_abilities.json
```bash
# Replace your current file with the new structure that includes:
- universal_element_abilities (Tiers 1-5)
- custom_esprit_abilities (Tiers 6+) 
- support_skills (for team combat)
- All abilities now have "effects" arrays with advanced combat effects
```

### 2. CombatService Integration
```python
# CombatService now:
‚úÖ Gets actual tier from team leader  
‚úÖ Scales all effects by tier automatically
‚úÖ Processes multiple effects per ability
‚úÖ Handles advanced effects with proper scaling
‚úÖ Integrates with your existing team system
```

### 3. NO CHANGES NEEDED TO:
```python
‚ùå AbilityService resolution logic (works as-is)
‚ùå TeamService (works as-is)  
‚ùå Database models (works as-is)
‚ùå Existing quest/combat UI (works as-is)
```

## üéÆ COMBAT EXAMPLE

### Player Action:
```
Player uses Flameheart's "Soul Incinerate" (Tier 6 Ultimate)
```

### System Processing:
```python
# 1. Get ability data
ability = {"name": "Soul Incinerate", "power": 175, "effects": ["burn", "berserker_rage", "elemental_weakness"]}

# 2. Calculate damage  
base_damage = calculate_damage(player_attack, boss_defense, 175)  # 2,340 damage

# 3. Apply effects with Tier 6 scaling
await apply_effect("burn", target="boss", tier=6)           # 8% burn per turn
await apply_effect("berserker_rage", target="player", tier=6)  # +18% damage per turn, 4 turns
await apply_effect("elemental_weakness", target="boss", tier=6) # Next opposing attack = 2.6x damage

# 4. Combat result
- Boss takes 2,340 damage + burn DoT
- Player enters berserker rage (+18% damage stacking)  
- Boss vulnerable to water attacks (2.6x damage)
```

## üöÄ WHAT THIS GIVES YOU

### ‚úÖ Perfect Tier Progression
- Tier 1-5: Universal abilities, progressively more effects
- Tier 6+: Custom unique abilities with advanced effect combinations
- Higher tiers = genuinely more powerful with same effect types

### ‚úÖ Strategic Depth  
- Players must choose which advanced effects to prioritize
- Team composition matters (element matching, tier diversity)
- Combat becomes tactical with effect timing and resource management

### ‚úÖ Easy to Expand
- Add new custom Esprits in "custom_esprit_abilities"
- Create new advanced effects in CombatService
- Scale difficulty by giving bosses advanced effects too

### ‚úÖ Balanced Progression
- No single "best" effect - different situations need different strategies
- Higher tiers feel meaningfully more powerful
- Lower tiers still viable with good team composition

## üéØ READY TO IMPLEMENT?

1. **Replace esprit_abilities.json** with the new structure
2. **CombatService is ready** - no additional changes needed
3. **Test with a Tier 6 custom Esprit** to see advanced effects in action
4. **Scale boss HP** to match new player power levels

**Your tiered ability system + advanced combat effects = strategic turn-based combat that scales perfectly from Tier 1 to Tier 12!**
